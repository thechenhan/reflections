How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

1. When we failed to add a new function, or during the updating, we massed up something.
2. We delete something first, however we want this function to be back
3. To visually check the progress of software development.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
1. it is logical, and conveinent for me to track the development process
2. sometimes, I will forget to commit. 


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Cuz these files are related to each other. Such as they will use the same button, when a users change something in one file, they have to change them at the same time. We make a commit to make sure that all the files are at the same version.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log filename
git diff oldversionID newoversionID

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It's easy to go back ,and my data will not be lost.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
stupid, just for building my work.
